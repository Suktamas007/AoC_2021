The first parameter to check is the power consumption.\n","\n","You need to use the binary numbers in the diagnostic report to generate two new binary numbers (called the gamma rate and the epsilon rate). The power consumption can then be found by multiplying the gamma rate by the epsilon rate.\n","\n","Each bit in the gamma rate can be determined by finding the most common bit in the corresponding position of all numbers in the diagnostic report. For example, given the following diagnostic report:\n","\n","00100\n","11110\n","10110\n","10111\n","10101\n","01111\n","00111\n","11100\n","10000\n","11001\n","00010\n","01010\n","Considering only the first bit of each number, there are five 0 bits and seven 1 bits.

So, the epsilon rate is 01001, or 9 in decimal. Multiplying the gamma rate (22) by the epsilon rate (9) produces the power consumption, 198.\n","\n","Use the binary numbers in your diagnostic report to calculate the gamma rate and epsilon rate, then multiply them together.
